# MaskWearing-ObjectDetection



A group task surrounding object detection. 
This specific project is using Computer Vision techniques such as image classification and object detection to identify cases in images where people are either wearing their masks correctly or incorrectly

Usinhg bounding boxes created using Roboflow to identify the area in which the masks are positioned, the labels were "Correctly worn masks" and "Incorrectly worn masks"

The group initially started using CNN and RNN models to achieve this.
